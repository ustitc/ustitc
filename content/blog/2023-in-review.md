This was a hot period. We moved to the UAE, I started a new job, and we stayed most of the time at home. A 
thermal, physical and mental challenge at the same time. 

It was also the most challenging year in terms of work. During this year I understood how much I lack skills in 
managing myself in terms of time and energy.

But regardless of that, I enjoyed this year. I felt safe in Dubai and really liked the city. I also managed
to catch up with friends and make new ones.

## Gadgets

Steam Deck is the gadget of the year. We stayed most of the time at home, and it became the best way to entertain 
ourselves and stay sane. 

## Software

[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com). Became my go-to tool for every meeting and in several occasions it is now much
easier for me to draw prototypes there, than using pen and paper.

## Video games

[Baldur's Gate 3](https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/1086940/). It reminds me about real tabletop RPGs that 
we run with the friends. Same insanity and love.

## Board games

[Wingspan](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/266192/wingspan). I think we would still play Everdell if we had a
physical version. But we had only a digital one with which we started to get annoyed. We searched for similar
experience, a bit strategic and also beautifully illustrated.

## Books

**Thinking in systems**

Book gave me an insight of what I like in software development - investigating how systems work.

**Four Thousand Weeks**

I have never read anything about time management, but after failing to gain focus at work I decided that the time 
has come. I haven't gained practical advices on how control the time, but understood the importance of not spending time
on unnecessary things.

**The Creative Act**

I use it to motivate myself, that's why I keep it close and open a random page from time-to-time.

**Think: A Compelling Introduction to Philosophy**

For long time I wanted to dive into the topic of philosophy and this year I started the journey with this introduction.
