This was a hot period. We moved to the UAE, I started a new job, and we spent most of our time at home — a thermal,
physical, and mental challenge all at once.

Despite everything, I enjoyed the year. I grew accustomed to Dubai and really liked the city.

## Gadgets

The Steam Deck was my gadget of the year. Since we spent most of our time at home, it became the best way to stay
entertained and sane.

## Software

[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) became my go-to tool for every meeting. In many cases, I now find it much easier to
draw prototypes there than to use pen and paper.

## Video games

[Baldur's Gate 3](https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/1086940/). It reminds me about real tabletop RPGs that
we run with the friends - the same delightful mix of chaos and love.

## Board games

[Wingspan](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/266192/wingspan). We might still be playing Everdell if we had a physical
version, but we only had the digital edition, which began to frustrate us. We sought a similar strategic experience, yet
beautifully illustrated — and found Wingspan.

## Books

**Thinking in systems**

This book gave me insight into what I enjoy most about software development — investigating how systems work.

**Four Thousand Weeks**

I had never read anything about time management, but after struggling to focus at work, I decided it was time to start.
While I didn’t gain practical advice on how to control my time, I did come to appreciate the importance of avoiding
unnecessary distractions and saying no.

**The Creative Act**

I use this book to motivate myself, keeping it close and opening a random page from time to time.

**Think: A Compelling Introduction to Philosophy**

For a long time, I wanted to explore philosophy, and this year I began my journey with this introduction.
