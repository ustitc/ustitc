The year was full of hatred and sadness. I revived my journaling habit just to have something where I could express the
pain and anger about everything happening in Russia.

I lived with a silly hope until September; then mobilization happened, and we relocated to Egypt.

Shortly after that, I started a job search and was eventually hired by Revolut.

## Gadgets

I bought a MacBook Pro M1 — perfect. After years of searching for a home workstation, I think I’ve finally found the
one.

## Software

[KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org). Sorry, 1Password—I couldn’t figure out how to pay for you, so I moved everything to
a 'self-hosted' alternative.

## Board games

[Everdell](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/199792/everdell). My wife and I entered the world of tabletop gaming, and
the first game we bought became our go-to for the year. Even after moving to another country, we continued playing it on
the iPad.

## Books

Most of the year was spent doom-scrolling, followed by attempts to escape reality by reading dark-fantasy books (because
reality wasn’t grim enough).

**Transhumanism Inc.**

Pelevin is the master.

**System Design Interview – An insider's guide**

It helped me systematize my knowledge and prepare for interviews.
