The year was full of hatred and sadness. I revived my journaling habit just to have something where I would be able
to express the pain and anger with everything that is happening with Russia.

I lived with a silly hope until September, then mobilisation happened, and we relocated to Egypt. 

Shortly after that I started job search and eventually got hired by Revolut.

## Gadgets

Bought Macbook Pro M1. Perfect. After years of search for the home workstation I think I finally found one.

## Software

[KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org). Sorry 1Password, I haven't found how to pay for you, that's why I moved 
everything to "self-hosted" alternative.

## Board games

[Everdell](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/199792/everdell). We opened the world of tabletop with my wife and the
first game that we bought became our go-to for this year. Even after moving to another country we continued playing 
it from the iPad.

## Books

Most of the year was dedicated to doom-scrolling and then attempts to escape reality by reading dark-fantasy
books (because reality is not grim enough).

**Transhumanism Inc.**

Pelevin is the master.

**System Design Interview â€“ An insider's guide**

Helped me to systematize my knowledge and prepare for the interviews.
