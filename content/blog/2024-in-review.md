Another relocation, this time to the UK. I hope that it will be the last one, at least for several years.

We traveled a lot and time was crawling very slowly. It seems like the UAE and Russia were decades ago. 

## Gadgets

**Fujifilm X-T20**

UK is way too beautiful to capture it with iPhone, that's why I bought a second-hand Fujifilm and spent second part
of the year chasing landscapes and birds.

**PlayStation 5**

Initial excitement turned into disappointment. Games seem boring, familiar and predictable. I don't get
the same feelings that I had playing Witcher and Death Stranding on PS4. The biggest regret was Space Marine 2.
Killing tyranids becomes a routine after several hours and the plot is not engaging. Maybe multiplayer is more
interesting, but I am not ready to pay for PS Plus subscription for that.

Although there was an exception in the form of [It Takes Two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAWHzGNcTEw) and an
experience of playing the game in split screen coop.

## Software

Gave up and moved to Apple ecosystem. Having a sync between devices and ability to family sharing
became more important than being a digital hermit. Obsidian was replaced with Notes and KeePassXC with Passwords.

I still love Obsidian and use it at work, but next year I plan to use simpler tools. I figured out that
my flow is quite boring and doesn't require all the cool features of Obsidian, like notes linking. Maybe someday, but
not today.

## Video game

This was a year of horde killing roguelikes:

- [Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2321470/Deep_Rock_Galactic_Survivor/)
- [Brotato](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/)
- [Halls of Torment](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2218750/Halls_of_Torment/)

They may look like ordinary time-killer, but after spending ~~way too much time~~ >100 hours on them, I started seeing
them as "puzzles with action like mechanics".

## Board game

[Terraforming Mars](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/167791/terraforming-mars). After a year of being nomads and
playing board games on iPad, we finally settled and bough a physical copy. And, and oh boy, what a pleasure it is 
to feel the cards.

## Books

**The Weirdness of the World**

I got tired, frustrated and stupid after Kant's Critique of Pure Reason and I
switched to modern philosophy authors. I started this book several times, postponed it during the year, but eventually
finished and liked it. Philosophy is fun and makes you feel weird about the world.

**The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language**

Linguistics was a second major subject after philosophy that excited me. But giving this book and several others a try,
I understood that this is not the topic I want to spend my time on. Thankfully it lead me to the idea that my
interest lies in the context of programming languages and using them as a tool to describe systems.

**How to Take Smart Notes**

I wish I have read it several years ago, when I started my journey with Obsidian. The book
is not only about how to make notes, but how to think and work.

**In the Dust of This Planet. Horror of Philosophy**

Being a fun of cosmic horror, I figured out that there is a whole
philosophy around it. Started this book as an introduction to the topic.
